# RandCat

![image][Website.png]

Welcome! This is a very simple project that retrieves cat images from Unsplash and lets the user save them in a Firebase database!

The functionality of this program is pretty straightforward: you can randomize the cat by clicking on the `new cat` button, and you can save a cat picture by clicking on the `save this cat!` button! All saved cats will be shown under the randomized cat in the `your saved cats!` section, where you can look at them and bask in their glorious beauty.

This project was developed using Next.js, React, and Firebase.

And that's everything! Enjoy!

Note that this was a project done after the bootcamp for FullStack@Brown!
